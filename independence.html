        <h2>World War II and the Freedom Struggle</h2>
        <p class="p-highlight">The outbreak of World War II in 1939 created a complex political situation in India. The British government, without consulting Indian leaders, declared India to be at war with Germany. This unilateral decision intensified the demand for immediate independence and shaped the final phase of the freedom struggle.</p>
        
        <p>The response to World War II revealed divergent strategies within the Indian national movement:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Congress Position:</strong> Initially refused to support the war effort without a clear commitment to Indian independence. Congress ministries in the provinces resigned in protest.</li>
          <li><strong>Muslim League Stance:</strong> Used the opportunity to build its position, cooperating with the British and consolidating support for a separate Muslim state.</li>
          <li><strong>Subhas Chandra Bose's Approach:</strong> Believed in taking advantage of Britain's weakened position during the war to gain independence. He escaped from house arrest and eventually formed the Indian National Army (INA) to fight alongside Japan against the British.</li>
          <li><strong>Communist Perspective:</strong> Initially opposed the war as "imperialist" but changed their position after Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet Union in 1941.</li>
        </ul>

              <p>Following Britain's unilateral decision to involve India in World War II, all Congress ministries in the provinces resigned in protest. This political vacuum allowed the Muslim League to gain strength in many regions.</p>

              <p>In response to the failure of the Cripps Mission, Gandhi launched the Quit India Movement, calling for immediate British withdrawal from India. He gave the famous call: "Do or Die" â€“ either free India or die in the attempt.</p>
              <p>The British responded with mass arrests of Congress leaders, leaving the movement without direction. Despite this, spontaneous protests erupted across the country, demonstrating the depth of anti-colonial sentiment.</p>

        <h2>Independence and Partition</h2>
        <p class="p-highlight">On August 15, 1947, India finally achieved independence after nearly 200 years of British rule. However, the joy of freedom was tempered by the tragedy of partition, which resulted in one of the largest migrations in human history and widespread communal violence.</p>

              <h4>Transfer of Power</h4>
              <p>Pakistan came into existence on August 14, 1947, while India gained independence at midnight on August 15. In Delhi, Jawaharlal Nehru delivered his famous "Tryst with Destiny" speech to the Constituent Assembly:</p>
              <p class="p-quote">"At the stroke of the midnight hour, when the world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom. A moment comes, which comes but rarely in history, when we step out from the old to the new, when an age ends, and when the soul of a nation, long suppressed, finds utterance."</p>

              <h4>Mass Migration and Communal Violence</h4>
              <p>The partition led to a mass migration of approximately 15 million people, with Hindus and Sikhs moving to India and Muslims to Pakistan. The migration was accompanied by horrific violence that claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. Gandhi worked tirelessly to restore peace, especially in Calcutta and Delhi.</p>

        <h2>The Challenges of Freedom</h2>
        <p>Independent India faced numerous challenges:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Refugee Rehabilitation:</strong> Resettling millions of refugees who had fled from what became Pakistan.</li>
          <li><strong>Integration of Princely States:</strong> Integrating over 560 princely states into the Indian Union, a task led by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.</li>
          <li><strong>Economic Development:</strong> Building an economy that could address widespread poverty and underdevelopment resulting from colonial exploitation.</li>
          <li><strong>Constitution-Making:</strong> Creating a constitution for the new nation that would reflect its democratic and secular aspirations.</li>
          <li><strong>Foreign Policy:</strong> Establishing India's position in international affairs during the emerging Cold War.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Despite these challenges, India succeeded in establishing a democratic system, maintaining unity amidst diversity, and setting the foundation for future development.</p>

        <h2>Legacy of the Freedom Struggle</h2>
        <p>India's struggle for independence left a lasting legacy:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>It provided a model of non-violent resistance that inspired anti-colonial and civil rights movements worldwide.</li>
          <li>It demonstrated the power of mass mobilization and the importance of inclusive leadership.</li>
          <li>It shaped India's democratic institutions and political culture.</li>
          <li>It established principles that continue to guide India's approach to international relations, including anti-imperialism, non-alignment, and peaceful coexistence.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="p-quote">"Long years ago we made a tryst with destiny, and now the time comes when we shall redeem our pledge... The achievement we celebrate today is but a step, an opening of opportunity, to the greater triumphs and achievements that await us." - Jawaharlal Nehru, August 15, 1947</p>
