        <h2>Birth of Indian Nationalism</h2>
        <p class="p-highlight">Following the Revolt of 1857, resistance to British rule transformed from sporadic rebellions to a more organized political movement. The period from 1885 to 1919 saw the emergence of Indian nationalism as an intellectual and political force that laid the foundation for the freedom struggle that would follow.</p>
        
        <p>Several factors contributed to the growth of nationalism during this period:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Western Education:</strong> English education introduced Indians to liberal, democratic ideas and concepts of liberty, equality, and nationalism.</li>
          <li><strong>Economic Exploitation:</strong> British economic policies drained India's wealth and hindered industrial development, creating economic grievances.</li>
          <li><strong>Racial Discrimination:</strong> Discriminatory treatment of Indians by the British created a sense of unity among Indians.</li>
          <li><strong>Cultural Revival:</strong> A reawakening of pride in Indian history, culture, and achievements strengthened Indian identity.</li>
          <li><strong>Transportation and Communication:</strong> Improvements in these areas helped connect and unify people across different regions of India.</li>

        <h2>Formation and Early Years of the Indian National Congress</h2>
        <p>The Indian National Congress, founded in 1885, became the primary platform for Indians to express their political, economic, and social aspirations.</p>

              <h4>Foundation of the Indian National Congress</h4>
              <p>The first session of the Indian National Congress was held in Bombay (now Mumbai) on December 28, 1885, with 72 delegates. It was organized by Allan Octavian Hume, a retired British civil servant, along with prominent Indians like Dadabhai Naoroji and Dinshaw Wacha.</p>
              <p class="p-note">In its early years, the Congress was moderate in its demands, seeking reforms within the framework of British rule rather than independence.</p>

              <h4>Partition of Bengal</h4>
              <p>Lord Curzon's decision to partition Bengal along religious lines (Hindu-Muslim) sparked widespread protests and a national movement known as the Swadeshi Movement. This marked a turning point that radicalized many nationalists.</p>

              <p>Leaders like Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Lala Lajpat Rai, and Bipin Chandra Pal (known as the Lal-Bal-Pal trio) advocated for more aggressive methods of protest, including boycott of British goods and promotion of swadeshi (indigenous) products.</p>
              <p>The Congress split at the Surat session in 1907 between the Moderates (led by Gopal Krishna Gokhale) and Extremists (led by Tilak), reflecting different approaches to achieving political goals.</p>

          <h3>Bal Gangadhar Tilak (1856-1920)</h3>
          <p class="p-highlight">Known for his declaration "Swaraj (self-rule) is my birthright, and I shall have it," Tilak advocated for more aggressive methods of protest. He revived public celebrations of Ganesh Chaturthi and Shivaji Jayanti to foster national pride and unity.</p>
          
          <h3>Bipin Chandra Pal (1858-1932)</h3>

        <h2>Revolutionary Movement</h2>
        <p>Alongside the mainstream nationalist movement, a more radical revolutionary strand also emerged during this period:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Anushilan Samiti and Jugantar:</strong> Secret revolutionary organizations formed in Bengal to overthrow British rule through armed struggle.</li>
          <li><strong>India House:</strong> Established in London by Shyamji Krishna Varma, it became a center for revolutionary activities abroad.</li>
          <li><strong>Notable Revolutionaries:</strong> Figures like Bhagat Singh, Chandrashekhar Azad, and V.D. Savarkar emerged during this period, advocating for complete independence through revolutionary means.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="p-note">While these revolutionary activities did not directly lead to independence, they created a sense of nationalistic fervor and inspired future generations of freedom fighters.</p>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>Legacy of the Early Nationalist Movement</h2>
        <p>The early nationalist period laid the foundation for the mass movements that would follow under Gandhi's leadership:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>It created political awareness among Indians across regions and communities.</li>
          <li>It established organizational structures that would be utilized for future mobilization.</li>
          <li>It articulated a critique of colonial rule that highlighted both economic exploitation and the denial of rights.</li>
          <li>It developed a vision of a free India based on democratic principles.</li>
          <li>It fostered a sense of national identity that transcended regional, linguistic, and religious differences.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="p-quote">"The contribution of the early nationalists in creating an all-India national consciousness and in training the Indian people in politics cannot be overestimated." - Historian Bipan Chandra</p>
