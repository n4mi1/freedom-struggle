        <h2>The Rise of Mahatma Gandhi</h2>
        <p class="p-highlight">Following his successful Champaran Satyagraha in 1917, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi emerged as a key leader in India's freedom struggle. His philosophy of non-violent resistance (Satyagraha) transformed the independence movement into a mass movement that involved all segments of society.</p>
        
        <p>Gandhi's approach was based on several principles:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Satyagraha (Truth Force):</strong> Non-violent resistance based on the power of truth and the need to convert, not coerce, the opponent.</li>
          <li><strong>Ahimsa (Non-violence):</strong> Rejection of physical violence as a means of political change.</li>
          <li><strong>Swadeshi:</strong> Self-reliance through the use of indigenous goods and boycott of foreign products.</li>
          <li><strong>Swaraj (Self-rule):</strong> Political, economic, and spiritual independence for India.</li>
          <li><strong>Sarvodaya:</strong> The upliftment of all sections of society, including the removal of untouchability and promotion of Hindu-Muslim unity.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="p-quote">"Non-violence is the greatest force at the disposal of mankind. It is mightier than the mightiest weapon of destruction devised by the ingenuity of man." - Mahatma Gandhi</p>

              <h4>Rowlatt Satyagraha and Jallianwala Bagh Massacre</h4>
              <p>The Rowlatt Act of 1919 authorized the government to imprison people without trial, leading to protests across India. On April 13, 1919, British troops under General Dyer fired on a peaceful gathering at Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar, killing hundreds of unarmed civilians.</p>
              <p class="p-note">The massacre deeply shocked Gandhi and the nation, leading to a more decisive turn toward the goal of complete independence.</p>

            <div class="timeline-content">
              <h4>Non-Cooperation Movement</h4>
              <p>Gandhi's first major nationwide movement called for the boycott of British institutions, courts, schools, and goods. It also included the surrender of government titles and the promotion of swadeshi products.</p>
              <p>The movement gained widespread support but was abruptly called off by Gandhi after the Chauri Chaura incident in February 1922, where protesters burned a police station, killing 22 policemen.</p>

              <h4>Simon Commission Boycott</h4>
              <p>The all-white Simon Commission was appointed to suggest constitutional reforms for India. Indians boycotted the commission with the slogan "Simon Go Back." During a protest in Lahore, Lala Lajpat Rai was fatally injured by police lathi (baton) charges.</p>

              <p>The Nehru Report, drafted by Motilal Nehru, demanded dominion status for India. When the British rejected these demands, the Congress passed the Purna Swaraj (Complete Independence) resolution in December 1929 at its Lahore session under the presidency of Jawaharlal Nehru.</p>

              <h4>Civil Disobedience Movement and Salt March</h4>
              <p>The movement began with the famous Dandi March (Salt Satyagraha), where Gandhi walked 388 kilometers from Sabarmati Ashram to Dandi to make salt in defiance of British salt laws. The movement spread across India with various forms of civil disobedience.</p>
              <p class="p-quote">"With this, I am shaking the foundations of the British Empire." - Mahatma Gandhi, picking up salt at Dandi</p>

              <h4>Gandhi-Irwin Pact and Round Table Conferences</h4>
              <p>The pact between Gandhi and Viceroy Lord Irwin led to the suspension of the Civil Disobedience Movement and the release of political prisoners. Gandhi attended the Second Round Table Conference in London but returned disappointed as the British were unwilling to grant substantial political concessions.</p>

        <h2>Social Reform and Constructive Program</h2>
        <p>Gandhi believed that the freedom struggle was not only about political independence but also about social and economic transformation:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Removal of Untouchability:</strong> Gandhi campaigned against caste discrimination and renamed untouchables as "Harijans" (children of God).</li>
          <li><strong>Women's Empowerment:</strong> He encouraged women to participate in the freedom struggle, breaking traditional barriers.</li>
          <li><strong>Village Reconstruction:</strong> Gandhi emphasized the development of village industries to create a self-sufficient rural economy.</li>
          <li><strong>Basic Education (Nai Talim):</strong> He proposed an education system focused on practical skills and moral values.</li>
          <li><strong>Hindu-Muslim Unity:</strong> Throughout the period, Gandhi worked for communal harmony, often fasting to end riots and violence.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="p-highlight">Gandhi's constructive program aimed to prepare Indians for independence by building self-reliance and addressing social problems. The spinning wheel (charkha) became a symbol of this approach, representing economic independence and dignity of labor.</p>

          <h3>Maulana Abul Kalam Azad (1888-1958)</h3>
          <p>A prominent Muslim leader who served as Congress president and advocated for Hindu-Muslim unity. He opposed the partition of India on religious lines.</p>

        <h2>Impact and Legacy</h2>
        <p>The Gandhian era transformed the Indian freedom struggle in several ways:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>It changed the nature of the independence movement from an elite pursuit to a mass movement involving peasants, workers, women, and other marginalized groups.</li>
          <li>It introduced new methods of resistance that were accessible to ordinary people and difficult for the British to suppress without losing moral legitimacy.</li>
          <li>It fostered a unique political culture that combined modern democratic aspirations with indigenous traditions and values.</li>
          <li>It placed ethics and morality at the center of politics, influencing future leaders and movements worldwide, including the American Civil Rights Movement under Martin Luther King Jr.</li>
