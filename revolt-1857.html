        <h2>Origins and Causes</h2>
        <p class="p-highlight">The Revolt of 1857 was a watershed moment in Indian history. What began as a mutiny of sepoys (Indian soldiers in the British East India Company's army) in Meerut on May 10, 1857, soon expanded into a widespread uprising against British rule across northern and central India.</p>
        
        <p>Multiple factors contributed to the uprising:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Military Grievances:</strong> The immediate trigger was the introduction of the new Enfield rifle cartridges, which were rumored to be greased with cow and pig fat. To load these rifles, soldiers needed to bite off the ends of cartridges, which offended both Hindu and Muslim religious sentiments.</li>
          <li><strong>Annexation Policies:</strong> Lord Dalhousie's Doctrine of Lapse allowed the British to annex states where rulers died without natural heirs, threatening the sovereignty of princely states.</li>
          <li><strong>Economic Exploitation:</strong> Heavy taxation, land revenue policies, and the destruction of traditional industries had caused widespread economic distress.</li>
          <li><strong>Cultural and Religious Fears:</strong> Activities of Christian missionaries and social reforms implemented by the British created fears about forced conversions and loss of cultural identity.</li>
          <li><strong>General Discontent:</strong> British policies had alienated multiple sections of society including rulers of states, landlords, peasants, artisans, and religious leaders.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Key Leaders of the Revolt</h2>
        <div>
          <h3>Bahadur Shah Zafar (1775-1862)</h3>
          <p>The last Mughal emperor, though elderly and with limited real power, became a symbolic figurehead of the rebellion. After the rebellion's failure, he was exiled to Rangoon where he died.</p>
          
          <h3>Rani Lakshmibai (1828-1858)</h3>
          <p class="p-highlight">The Queen of Jhansi became one of the leading figures of the rebellion, fighting against British forces until her death in battle. Her courage and leadership skills made her a legendary figure in Indian history.</p>
          
          <h3>Nana Sahib (1824-1859?)</h3>
          <p>Adopted son of the last Peshwa of the Maratha Empire, he led the rebellion in Kanpur. After the rebellion's failure, he fled, and his fate remains unknown.</p>
          
          <h3>Tantia Tope (1814-1859)</h3>
          <p>A close associate of Nana Sahib and a skilled military commander who led rebel forces in central India. He was eventually captured and executed.</p>
          
          <h3>Begum Hazrat Mahal (1820-1879)</h3>
          <p>The wife of the deposed Nawab of Awadh, she led the rebellion in Lucknow and declared her son as the rightful nawab. After the rebellion's failure, she sought refuge in Nepal.</p>

        <h2>Aftermath and Significance</h2>
        <p>While the rebellion was ultimately suppressed by mid-1858, it had far-reaching consequences:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>End of Company Rule:</strong> The British Crown took direct control of India from the East India Company. Queen Victoria issued a proclamation promising non-interference in religious matters and greater inclusion of Indians in government.</li>
          <li><strong>Administrative Reorganization:</strong> The British implemented significant changes in administration, military organization, and policies to prevent future rebellions. They began to rely more on ethnic, religious, and caste divisions to maintain control.</li>
          <li><strong>Changing British Attitudes:</strong> British policies became more conservative and cautious. There was a growing racial divide and increasing distrust between the British and Indians.</li>
          <li><strong>Nationalist Awakening:</strong> The revolt, despite its failure, planted the seeds of nationalism and inspired future generations of freedom fighters.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="p-quote">"The revolt of 1857 marks the end of an era and the beginning of a new era in the history of India, when the country came under the formal control of the British Crown." - Historian R.C. Majumdar</p>
        
        <p class="p-note">While British historians often referred to it as the "Sepoy Mutiny," Indian historians have termed it the "First War of Independence," reflecting its significance in India's struggle against colonial rule.</p>
